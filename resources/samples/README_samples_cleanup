TCGA Sample Deduplication Strategy
Overview
In many instances, there is more than one aliquot for a given combination of individual, platform, and data type. However, only one aliquot may be ingested into the analysis pipeline. Therefore, a set of precedence rules are applied to select the most scientifically advantageous sample among duplicates.

Filtering Strategy
Two sequential filters are applied to achieve sample deduplication:

1. Analyte Replicate Filter
The following precedence rules are applied when aliquots have differing analytes:

For RNA aliquots:

T analytes are dropped in preference to H and R analytes (T is the inferior extraction protocol)
When both H and R are present, H is chosen as the preferred analyte
If multiple aliquots exist for the chosen RNA analyte, the aliquot with the later plate number is selected
For DNA aliquots:

D analytes (native DNA) are preferred over G, W, or X (whole-genome amplified) analytes
Exception: G, W, or X analyte samples are chosen if they have a higher plate number than D analytes
2. Sort Replicate Filter
When the analyte filter still produces multiple samples:

The aliquot with the highest lexicographical sort value is chosen
This ensures selection of the barcode with the highest portion and/or plate number when all other barcode fields are identical
